* - "Where is pallet 28?" It was an exact duplicate of 27, so I   *
*   didn't include it.                                            *
* - "What's wrong with pallet 26?" I don't know; for some reason  *
*   it doesn't look complete?  This could be an issue with the    *
*   360 version; I'll check for certain once I can access the     *
*   data on the PS3 version.                                      *
* - "Which ones are for Sho and which ones are for Minazuki?"     *
*   Sho and Minazuki literally have the exact same data on the    *
*   disk, with the exception of pallet and scripting data.        *
* - "What are the files labled "tmp" for?" These are temporary    *
*   stand-ins used while the game was in development.  Some of    *
*   Sho's remained in his data.                                   *
*                                                                 *
